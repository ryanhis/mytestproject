# mytestproject
Test project to get a handle on repositories. Probably will delete.


Okay, no seriously this time. This time I am going to be committing changes to the main branch, not just editing the main branch directly.

I swear.

Please believe me.

Don't you? You...don't believe me?
----------------------------------
I am making some changed to the readme now. 

I am hoping to commit these changes back to the main branch of my test thing here. 

Let me know if this doesn't work.
